# RTv1

## Project objective
RTv1 is a simple ray tracing program. It parses a 3D scene from a file and applies ray tracing algorithm to render the given scene.

## Skills to acquire and use
•	Fundamentals of C  
•	Algorithm elaboration   
•	Imperative programming   
•	Rigor   
•	Graphics 
• Getting acquainted with the ray tracing rendering technique    

## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile.
Run it with `./RTv1 [scene]`. A bunch of sample scence are provided in the `scene` directory. 
You can see control instructions by clicking [i]
